# Jira Express <img src="./.github/banner.png" width="90" align="left">

A quick access to your Jira tickets.

<br />
<br />

Jira Express is a Chrome and Firefox extension that gives you a quick access to your recent Jira tickets and to a simplified Jira search.

Built with Create React App, TypeScript, and Styled-Components.

**⚠️ Jira Express is still a WIP and it's not yet available in the Chrome and Firefox web stores.**

## Overview

**Jira Express is not a substitute of the full blown Jira interface.**  
My goal with this project was just to create something that would allow me to avoid opening the Jira web interface as much as possible by speeding up the ticket search process.
